Launched in the brand\u2019s flagship London store in November 2015, the A I R collection was inspired by a range of wearable sculptures previously premiered during London Fashion Week. Coloured with five different reactive inks, each piece was designed to respond individually to climactic changes. Harnessing these innovations with a more practical, everyday use, the collection included a heat reactive scarf patterned with devor\u00e9, a fabric technique also known as burnout. Among the other limited-edition items was a wallet and phone case covered in touch-sensitive formulas that responded to the wearer\u2019s circulation and a leather backpack that changed colour in contact with heat, light, shade and changes in air pressure. Describing the visualisation of colour as a \u201cuniversal language\u201d, Lauren Bowker, founder of T H E U N S E E N, explained: \u0022Our accessory collection allows people to interact and view the wonders of our formulas for themselves.

Unveiled during London Fashion Week in September 2014, the Black Spinel stones respond to the wearer\u2019s brain activity. Modulations in emotion, from happiness and excitement to nerves and fear, produce different colours across a gradient of black to orange, red, green, blue and purple. These accelerate dramatically in tandem with any shift in feeling and provide a dazzling correlation between precious matter and the world of material science. Replicating the characteristics of the human bone, each gemstone was coated in a temperature sensitive colour-change ink, enabling a pronounced illustration of emotive forces around the skull.

Conceived for the first pilots and passengers to embark on a commercial mission to space, the brief was to conceptualise, design and develop a futuristic update on the embroidered version traditionally worn when travelling beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Initially dormant, the patch is activated during training in the Mojave Desert by body and wind temperatures. It becomes engaged and changes colour as the astronaut journeys through outer space and turns Virgin Galactic blue at exospheric temperatures.

Launched at Salone del Mobile, one of the world\u2019s premier design fairs, five glass boxes formed the Essenze installation, with each environment responding to individuals entering the pods. \u201cScientifically, it proves incredibly difficult to categorize emotions outside of controlled studies and even then emotion monitoring can be considered subjective,\u201d said Lauren. \u201cHowever, by creating contained environments filled with blended ingredients entwined with colour we hope to create a sanctuary space that distils and enhances the feelings of emotion towards each scent.\u201d Speaking about the launch, which was designed to promote five new fragrances at the Ermenegildo Zegna flagship store in Milan, Lauren commented: \u201cWe drew affinity from the craftsmanship and innovative nature of Zegna combined with the artisanal and intricate skills of Estee Lauder.\u201d\n  \u003C\/p\u003E","quote":"\u003Cp\u003E\u201cAn exceptional experience developed thanks to a totally innovative technology that T H E U N S E E N made us discover.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E","attribution":"\u003Cp\u003EAlessandro Sartori | Creative Director | Zegna\u003C\/p\u003E","element":null},{"type":"project","title":"Innovate UK","slug":"innovate-uk","summary":"Agitation and anxiety, peace and placidity, can the E I G H T H S E N S E read your aura?\r\n","thumbnail":{"type":"image","id":"246","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_innovate_1.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_innovate_1.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_innovate_1.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_innovate_1.jpg"}]},"blocks":[{"type":"text","text":"A coded couture piece that measures the imperceptible aura emitted by humans in real-time"},{"type":"twoAssets","assets":[{"type":"image","id":"248","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_innovate_3.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_innovate_3.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_innovate_3.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_innovate_3.jpg"}]},{"type":"image","id":"249","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_innovate_4.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_innovate_4.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_innovate_4.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_innovate_4.jpg"}]}],"order":"rightFirst"},{"type":"asset","asset":{"type":"image","id":"247","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_innovate_2.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_innovate_2.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_innovate_2.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_innovate_2.jpg"}]},"caption":"A coded couture piece that measures the imperceptible aura emitted by humans in real-time"},{"type":"twoAssets","assets":[{"type":"image","id":"366","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_eighthsense_ills.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_eighthsense_ills.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_eighthsense_ills.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_eighthsense_ills.jpg"}]},{"type":"image","id":"367","size":[1600,2560],"srcs":[{"size":[600,960],"url":"\/assets\/_small\/theunseen_eighthsense-ceramic.jpg"},{"size":[1200,1920],"url":"\/assets\/_medium\/theunseen_eighthsense-ceramic.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_large\/theunseen_eighthsense-ceramic.jpg"},{"size":[1600,2560],"url":"\/assets\/_1600x2560_crop_center-center_75\/theunseen_eighthsense-ceramic.jpg"}]}],"order":"leftFirst"}],"url":"https:\/\/seetheunseen.co.uk\/projects\/innovate-uk","description":"\u003Cp\u003EEI G H T H S E N S E is a coded couture piece that measures the imperceptible force emitted by all humans.

To capture this transition, she revisited the familiar motif of feathers, which have frequently been deployed by T H E U N S E E N as an artefact of graceful symbolism. \u201cIn old Egyptian mythology, when you died, your heart was measured against a feather and if it was heavier you went to hell and if it was lighter you went to heaven,\u201d said Lauren of their enduring power. Inspired by P H N X, her RCA graduate collection, which led to a collaboration with the fashion house Peachoo+Krejberg worn by Kate Moss, Browns\u2019 colour-change feathers were displayed at their flagship London store to portray the company\u2019s evolving identity and signal this transition from black to white, past to future.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E","quote":"\u003Cp\u003E\u201cI use feathers for their magical and enchanting nature.

Following a lengthy spell in hospital, Lauren returned to Manchester University at the age of 18 determined to refigure her creative outlook and approach. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make fashion or textiles, things that were unable or not designed to answer my questions about life and the challenges it presents. I wondered if I could take some of my skills in design and colour and material manipulation and start to think of them as language and communicator tools,\u201d she explained. The result was the pollution-absorbing jacket which, as Lauren admits, \u201cinspired everything\u201d that was to come. Prompted by a Royal Society of Arts initiative to stop teenagers using cigarettes, Lauren developed a primitive lipstick that changed colour in response to smoking. Her research journey continued in Manchester over the next three years, in tandem with a group of PhD students and a cross-disciplinary approach to textiles and chemistry.

Remaining connected and committed to the physical and the abiding theme of making the invisible visible, T H E U N S E E N has devised a hair colour that can only be seen through a lens.
